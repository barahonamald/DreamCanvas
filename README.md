### Project description (1-3 paragraphs)
The goal of this project is to design a 3-dimensional painting tool. The user should be able to paint with the VR controller using a variety of tools that simulate real tools such as paintbrushes, pencils, and charcoal. The user should also be able to use tools that are impossible to use in the real world such as painting by repeatedly placing 3D models or 2D stickers or “living” paint that continuously flows like water.

The user should be able to paint either in their current environment using the pass-through feature of the Meta Quest. Alternatively, the user should be able to paint in a minimalistic “void” where they can focus on their work and not their environment.

Additionally, we want to provide the user with a way to save and visualize their work outside of VR. Ideally there would be two ways to do this. First, the user should be able to export a 2-dimensional screenshot of their work from a specific viewpoint. Second, the user should also be able to export a 3-dimensional model that can be viewed and exported to a laptop.

One of our motivations for this project is to help the users be able to visualize any home remodeling they would like to do. By using our VR application, the user would be able to see how certain furniture would fit in their surrounding environment, if certain color palettes would look better on the walls, etc. Some people do not have the physical capabilities to conceptualize an environment within their mind, so we are creating an external tool that will allow users to reshape the environment around them.

### A description of what you think you know how to do (as a group)
We have programming and engineering-based 3D modeling skills.
### A description of things you are less sure you know how to do (as a group)
Neither of us have experience with Unity or 3D modeling in typical art tools such as Blender.
### What equipment you plan to use
Meta Quest 3 + controllers
### Final Deliverables
The final deliverable of this project will be a VR environment that a user can enter and freely paint in 3-dimensions. The user should be able to paint using a variety of tools and be able to export their final result as either a 3-dimensional model or a 2-dimensional image.
 
### Timeline/Milestones

| Week | Milestone |
| :--- | ---: |
| Week 1 | Checkout headset and present project proposal |
| Week 2 | Create a proof of concept in Unity |
| Week 3 | Research VR interaction |
| Week 4 | Create VR interaction proof of concept |
| Week 5 | Minimal viable product |
| Week 6 | Feature 1: different brushes |
| Week 7 | Feature 2: dynamic brushes |
| Week 8 | Feature 3: ability to save work |
| Week 9 | Deliver |

### Fallback/Contingency Plans
The bare minimum outcome would be the ability to draw with one tool in 3-dimensions. We plan to implement this first and build features on top.
Collaboration Plan
	We will use GitHub to share files and communicate on a twice weekly basis via cellular device.
Conflict Resolution Plan
	Communicate clearly our desires and needs as well as try to find common ground in any disagreements.
